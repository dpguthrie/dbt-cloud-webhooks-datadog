# dbt Cloud Webhooks - Datadog

## Overview

This repo contains code to send data retreived from dbt Cloud's [Metadata API]() and submit it as logs to datadog for further consumption.

## Requirements

Python 3.7+

- [datadog-api-client](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-api-client-python) - Python API client for the [Datadog API](Datadog API)
- [dbtc](https://dbtc.dpguthrie.com) - Unofficial python interface to dbt Cloud APIs
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) - Modern, fast, web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+
- [uvicorn](https://uvicorn.org) - ASGI web server implementation for Python 

## Getting Started

Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dpguthrie/dbt-cloud-webhooks-datadog.git
```

## Deploy on fly.io (Optional)

[fly.io](https://fly.io) is a platform for running full stack apps and databases close to your users.

### Install

Directions to install [here](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/)

Once installed, sign up for fly.io

```bash
flyctl auth signup
```

Now sign in

```bash
flyctl auth login
```

Launch your app!

```bash
flyctl launch
```

### Secrets

The following secrets need to be configured to your runtime environment for your application to work properly.

- DBT_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKEN - This is the secret key that's shown after initailly creating your webhook subscription in dbt Cloud
- DBT_CLOUD_SERVICE_TOKEN - Generate a [service token](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/service-tokens#generating-service-account-tokens) in dbt Cloud.  Ensure that it has at least the `Metadata Only` permission as we will be making requests against the Metadata API.

```bash
flyctl secrets set DBT_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKEN=***
```

Add to the command to set multiple:

```bash
flyctl secrets set DBT_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKEN=*** DBT_CLOUD_SERVICE_TOKEN=*** DD_API_KEY=*** DD_SITE=***
```

### Other Helpful Commands

Check the secrets set in your app
